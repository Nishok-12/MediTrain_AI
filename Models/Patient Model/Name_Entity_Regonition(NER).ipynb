I understand this might be worrying, but please know that we can take steps together to help you feel better. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’ªPlease follow the following steps to feel better and work towards your recovery: 1. Call an ambulance immediately if you or someone else is experiencing severe symptoms or if the situation is life-threatening. Time is critical in emergencies, so donâ€™t hesitate to call for professional help.2. Chew or swallow aspirin if advised by a healthcare professional and if you are experiencing chest pain, as it may help prevent further damage to the heart in cases of a heart attack. However, do this only if there are no contraindications for you.3. Keep calm and try to remain composed. Staying calm helps you think clearly and take the necessary actions.4. Perform CPR if needed and if you are trained to do so. Chest compressions can help maintain blood flow until medical professionals arrive.Remember, recovery takes time, but you're not alone in this journey. Stay positive! ðŸŒŸ\"  # Example user input\n",
